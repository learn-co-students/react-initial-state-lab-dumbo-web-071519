// your Bomb code here!
// ## A bomb timer

// Take a moment to think about what a bomb does and how it works.Don't get all
// into the nitty gritty â€” what we're going to focus on right now is the _timer_.

// Let's create a component that represents a bomb timer that counts down until it
// reaches`0`.However, the only thing we're going to focus on right now is
// setting the initial state of the bomb: the amount of seconds left on the timer.
// Since bomb timers can differ, we'll pass in a prop to our `Bomb` component to
// determine what the starting count should be.

// 1.  Its initial state should have a property called`secondsLeft`.
// 2.  The initial value of`secondsLeft` is set by passing in an`initialCount`
// prop to the`Bomb` component.Don't forget to pass the argument props into
// the constructor(i.e., `constructor(props)`).
// 3.  It should render the text`'<SECONDS_LEFT> seconds left before I go boom!'`,
//     where`<SECONDS_LEFT>` is the value of`secondsLeft`.
// 4. ** If`secondsLeft` equals`0`, it should render`'Boom!'` instead.**
